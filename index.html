                <td class="ab">I am Aniket Balodia, a first-year undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor’s 
                    of Technology in the field of Computer Science and Engineering with 
                    specialization in Artificial Intelligence from Netaji Subhas University of 
                    Technology (formerly known as NSIT), Dwarka, Delhi. I was born in Bihar 
                    but grew up in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh. I did my schooling from St. 
                    Therese’s School, Padrauna, UP.
                    
                    My idol is My father. I have seen him struggling day and night for his 
                    family, for earning money. Despite belonging to lower middle-class family 
                    and experiencing every day issues, He is well true upon his ethics which 
                    makes him different from others.
                    Being a human, I possess some of both positive and negative qualities. I am
                    always ready to grasp new techniques and desperate to gain more and more 
                    knowledge. I can't say that I do things accurately but make sure to learn 
                    from all my mistakes and not to repeat it again. I am highly organized and 
                    dedicated person towards my work and my schedule, mess in which can create 
                    a short-tempered situation too.
                    The last but not the least, my experience has taught me to deal with all my 
                    problems and my mistakes with an innovative and creative method which is a 
                    great success for me.</td>

                    My hobbies include playing outdoor games, video games, bike and car driving. 
                    I also love listening music to a great extent. I like to travel. I like to visit 
                    mountains and actually all the places in the world at least once. Since I started Coding this year, I also become enthusiastic about it and nowdays web deveopment is getting interest arena. Apart from this, I love cooking, singing and great interest in economics.
